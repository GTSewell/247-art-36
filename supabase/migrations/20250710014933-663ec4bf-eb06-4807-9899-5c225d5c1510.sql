  bio = 'Unwell Bunny''s artist history begins in Adelaide, Australia as a young 16 year old teen spraying walls and train lines. His initial ideas grew from 90''s graffiti following a mix of both letter and character based aerosol art.

He moved to Melbourne in 2002 and began showing his work in Melbourne galleries. He became active in the Melbourne street art scene leaving paste up and graffiti works through the lanes and suburbs of Melbourne.

He had his first solo exhibition at Per Square Meter in Melbourne was run by LA based duo Dabs Myla at the time. In 2012, he lived in Amsterdam and spent time with London graffiti and Street art heavy weight D*Face and Parisian pop graffiti icon Tilt. There he painted projects for Amsterdam street artists the London Police. In 2014, he was included in Metro gallery''s ''international street art exhibition'' with the likes of ELK, Rone, D*Face, Blek le Rat, and Faile earning a place as an emerging international Australian urban based artist.

In early 2015, he had a solo show at Galerie Lacroix in Paris, which continued the theme of figurative abstract painted works based on a subconscious dialog and drawings based on a build-up of popular culture imagery. He is currently working on future projects based both in Australia and internationally focusing on the further investigation into the popular subconscious.'
